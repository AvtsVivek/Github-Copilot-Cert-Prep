1. Say I have a c file, which I dont have much information about, and I want to understand it.
2. Let the file be F-02_2.c in the apps folder.
3. I can use inline code actions to explain the code in the file.
4. Open the file F-02_2.c, highlight the whole file, right click -> Copilot -> Explain.

6. Now select the code that is below that error, right click -> Copilot -> Explain.
